# Project title :
smart face attendance 
# Description : 
An employee attendance system based on face recognition.
If a face is already registered, the system recognizes it and marks the attendance.
If the face is not registered, the system prompts for the employee’s name and stores the new face data.
Later, the recognition process compares the captured face with the stored records to confirm the employee’s attendance, along with the time and status (on-time or late).
The attendance sheet is automatically updated and linked to a simple web page for generating attendance reports.
# Installation Instructions : 
python 
cmd write pip install opencv-python , dlib , numpy , face-recognition .
# Usage : 
1. Run the system by opening the project folder.  
2. Open the *Command Prompt (CMD)* inside the folder.  
3. Start the application by typing:
   python run_app.py 
   python main.py
4. The application will open.
If the employee’s face is already registered, the system will recognize it and record the attendance.
If the employee is new, the system will ask for the name and register the face in the database.
